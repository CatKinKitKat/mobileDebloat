Just copy and paste to your ADB shell or if rooted add #!/bin/sh to the first line and chmod +x it so you can ./execute it, but if it is rooted why are you still using the stock ROM? If you don't care about your warranty just flash TWRP and a GSI ROM right now. Unlike peasants like me who are waiting for the warranty to expire.
